Business website for Odd Logic Photography and Film

This is a business website for Odd Logic Photography and Film. This serves as a portfolio of the artists' work to generate future clients. I have included a gallery of the photographer's work, about me section for the photographer and editor, a page with package information, and a contact form. The stylization choices are in line with the brand designed by the photographer.

The CSS focus for this project includes:

*A horizontal navigation menu that at desktop that collapses into a hamburger menu when reduced to mobile sizes. The animated hamburger button opens and closes, transforming to an X when opened, revealing a vertical navigation menu. This can be viewed on the home (index.html) and packages pages.

*A Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views that rearranges content from a horizontal layout to a vertical layout when reduced from desktop to mobile sizes. This is implimented with the "Packages" section on the home page, or index.html. 

/*Perform a Web Accessibility Compliance review on your own site and document all the tools and testing you used to verify your site is accessible. This may involve a written write-up, screenshots, and other ways of showing that you evaluated your site for accessibility compliance. Include the report in your GitHub repository.*/

The Javascript focus for this project includes:

*A ‘Contact Us’ form), that validates at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then displays that information on the page back to the user with a button click (Preview). This can be seen near the bottom of both pages.

*Three bootstrap carousels show/hide multiple content areas on the Packages page through clicking a button or some other user interaction.

*Media queries are implemented for the navigation hamburger button, the gallery images grid, and the packages flexbox.
