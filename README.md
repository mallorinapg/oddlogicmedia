# Business website for Odd Logic Photography and Film

## Introduction

This is a business website for Odd Logic Photography and Film. This serves as a portfolio of the artists' work to generate future clients. I have included a gallery of the photographer's work, about me section for the photographer and editor, a page with package information, and a contact form. The stylization choices are in line with the brand designed by the photographer.

## The CSS focus for this project includes:

1. A horizontal navigation menu that at desktop that collapses into a hamburger menu when reduced to mobile sizes. The animated hamburger button opens and closes, transforming to an X when opened, revealing a vertical navigation menu. This can be viewed on the home (index.html) and packages pages.

2. A Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views that rearranges content from a horizontal layout to a vertical layout when reduced from desktop to mobile sizes. 
- photo gallery
- "Packages"
- "About Me"
- "Editor"

## The Javascript focus for this project includes:

1. A ‘Contact Us’ form), that validates at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then displays that information on the page back to the user with a button click (Preview). This can be seen near the bottom of both pages.

## Media Queries

Media queries are implemented for the navigation hamburger button, the gallery images grid, and the packages flexbox.

### Future plans for the project include:

1. Creating a pop-up form that is responsive to the contact form, thanking the user for their message and letting them know we will be back to them within 48hrs.

2. Three bootstrap carousels show/hide multiple content areas on the Packages page through clicking a button or some other user interaction.

3. Perform a Web Accessibility Compliance review on site and document all the tools and testing used to verify site is accessible. This may involve a written write-up, screenshots, and other ways of showing that site has been evaluated for accessibility compliance, including  the report in your GitHub repository.
